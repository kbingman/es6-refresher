# Lesson One

## Var, Let and Const

ES6 has added two new ways to define variables, in addition to the venerable `var`. `let` and `const` differ significantly
from `var` in both their scoping rules and in their mutability. 

## Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced a new format for functions, derived from the popular library, Coffeescript. 
These so-called `arrow functions` behave almost exactly, but not quite like normal Javascript 
functions. They differ in two important ways: they do not have an `arguments` keyword, giving them 
access to any arbitrary arguments passed into the function and they do not have their own `context`. 

Context refers to `this` one of the more confusing aspects of Javascript. Unlike other languages, the 
value of `this` varies depending on where it is called. You may have seen `var self = this` before, one 
of the more popular ways of redeclaring this to be sure of its current value.
